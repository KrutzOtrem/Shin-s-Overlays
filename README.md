# Shin's Overlays and Themes for 1024x768 Handhelds, Brick in Particular

## Preface

Greetings! In this repository, I’ll be sharing overlays and backgrounds I’ve created for my white Trimui Brick.

Although I’ll keep updating this repository, the first full theme I’m sharing is called *Pearly Gate*. The menu design takes inspiration from CRTs, and the emulator overlays are all based on original console samples—just reworked with modern color palettes to match the overall vibe.

I know this style won’t suit everyone, so I’ll also be creating other designs and color palettes, along with matching backgrounds to go with them. I'll also include the *Vanilla* version in case you’d prefer not to match the overlay with your theme. 

All overlays have a depth effect that probably took me longer to perfect than it should have. I didn’t make separate versions without it, but if you're not a fan, feel free to DM me and I’ll send you a set without the effect.

*Last significant overhaul: 18/04*

## Installation

Unzip the ZIP file and drag its contents into the **root** of your SD card. Alternatively, you can manually select the overlay you want and place it into the corresponding emulator folder inside the **Overlays** directory.

Inside each folder, you’ll find at least three overlays. *Overlay1* is always the base version—clean, with no gridlines, scanlines, or color effects. *Overlay2* includes the gridline or scanline effect with 1px that I think works best. *Overlay3* is for anyone looking for an LCD grid effect. Just a heads-up 'tho, since I used red-green-blue grids for this overlay, there’s a slight, inevitable color tint shift—but I actually prefer this look, and I know some friends who do too.

If you're not using a **TrimUI Brick** but another device with the same resolution, you can still use the same folder structure. In **RetroArch**, you can manually select the overlay folders. For detailed instructions, please refer to the official RetroArch manual on **Libretro**'s GitHub page.

All overlays are designed for **native** scaling, except for those made for home consoles. In that case, please use aspect ratio scaling instead.

## Font

For these four themes, I’m using the **Medodica Regular** font, and I highly recommend it!

To install it, simply download the font file and drag it into the root of your SD card. Alternatively, you can navigate through the folders until you find font1.ttf, then drag it into *.system/res/*.


## Specific Configuration

### CRT

Work In Progress

### GB

For Game Boy enjoyers, the grids are colored to match the original GB palette, and you'll find three different overlay layers. *Overlay1 to 2* follow the same structure as the others, but *Overlay3* features a green transparent background that mimics the original Game Boy's screen palette. 

Since everyone’s taste is different, I recommend experimenting with emulator colorization settings to see what works best for you. That said, these overlays were designed with GBC (Game Boy Color) colorization in mind. I know some consider that blasphemy, but personally, I think the color definition is quite solid. Plus, the overlay palette I used brings those GBC tones closer to the classic DMG feel.

If you're aiming for a more old-school vibe, *Overlay3*, *GBC* colorization, *Accurate* color correction with *Simple* interframe blending probably gets you the closest.

## Feedback

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me on Discord — **#pseudoinsomniac** — if you have any feedback on these overlays. I’m happy to share the PSD files or the custom grids I created in Paint.net. If you have suggestions for improvements, I’d genuinely appreciate hearing them. I’ll be updating these anyway, so I might as well get them right.

I already have custom-made CRT Native overlays, but they’re a bit sloppy at the moment since I suck at the brush, so I’d rather wait until they look at least passable before sharing them.

As for samples, I’ll upload them whenever I get the chance. But if you’re good with a camera, feel free to send me some shots—whether it’s just one or a few, so I can share.
