# Shin's Overlays for 1024x768 Handhelds

## Preface

Greetings! In this repository, I’ll be sharing overlays and backgrounds I’ve created for my white TrimUI Brick.

Although I’ll continue updating this repository, the first full theme I’m sharing is called *Pearly Gate*. The menu design is inspired by CRTs, and each emulator overlay is crafted from original console components—but reimagined with a modern twist and refreshed color palettes that suits the overall theme.

I know this style won’t suit everyone, so I’ll also be creating other designs and color palettes, along with matching backgrounds to go with them.

Inside each folder, you’ll find at least two overlays. Overlay1 is always the base version—clean, with no gridlines, scanlines, or color effects. Overlay2 includes the gridline or scanline effect I think works best. Overlay3 won’t always be there, but when it is, it combines gridlines with a colorization I feel suits the theme most.

All overlays, except those for home consoles (CRT), will be designed for integer scaling only.
