# Shin's Overlays for 1024x768 Handhelds

## Preface

Greetings! In this repository, I’ll be sharing overlays and backgrounds I’ve created for my white TrimUI Brick.

Although I’ll continue updating this repository, the first full theme I’m sharing is called *Pearly Gate*. The menu design is inspired by CRTs, and each emulator overlay is crafted from original console samples—but reimagined with a modern colors palettes that suits the overall theme.

I know this style won’t suit everyone, so I’ll also be creating other designs and color palettes, along with matching backgrounds to go with them. I'll also include the vanilla versions in case you’d prefer not to match the overlay with your theme.

## Installation

Unzip the ZIP file and drag its contents into the root of your SD card. Alternatively, you can manually select the overlay you want and place it into the corresponding emulator folder inside the 'Overlay' directory.

Inside each folder, you’ll find at least three overlays. Overlay1 is always the base version—clean, with no gridlines, scanlines, or color effects. Overlay2 includes the gridline or scanline effect with 1px that I think works best. Overlay3 is for anyone who wants a strong grid or scanline effect—the pixel lines are much thicker on this one.

All overlays, except those for home consoles (CRT), will be designed for integer scaling only.


## Specific Configuration

### CRT

### GB

For Game Boy enojeys, the grids are colored to match the original GB palette, and you'll find four different overlay layers. Overlays 1 to 3 follow the same structure as the others, but Overlay4 features a transparent background that mimics the original Game Boy's screen background.

Since everyone’s taste is different, I recommend experimenting with emulator colorization settings to see what works best for you. That said, these overlays were designed with GBC (Game Boy Color) palettes in mind. I know some consider that blasphemy, but personally, I think the color definition is quite solid. Plus, the overlay colorization I used brings those GBC tones closer to the classic DMG feel.

If you're aiming for a more old-school vibe, Overlay4 probably gets you the closest.
My personal favorite is Overlay2, paired with GBC colorization and simple blending.
